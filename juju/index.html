                        I was born in Ji-Paraná, in the State of Rondônia and lived there for 20 years.
                        In 2023, I moved to Curitiba, in Paraná, to attend college.
                        I am in the third semester of Systems Analysis and Development at the 
                        Federal University of Paraná (UFPR).
                        Currently, I work as an IT Apprentice at APK Logística e Transporte.
                        I am passionate about technology and learning new things.
                        My hobbies are playing computer games, watching anime, and playing RPGs.

                            Project developed with Matheus Grego do Amaral for the Web Programming I course. The goal was to create a website that connects to a database and, in response to a POST request, displays search results on the screen according to the user's input for filters, sorting, and result limits. All input fields had to undergo sanitization and additional validations.

                            Project developed with Matheus Grego, Raul Bana, and Rodolfo dos Santos for the Web Programming I course. The goal was to create a typing game with its own database to store data for each player, such as login, password, name, and score for each game. The game also features a league and ranking system. In this project, I primarily worked on database modeling, SQL queries, and backend validations.
